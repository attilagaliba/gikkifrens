System:
- You can subscribe monthly by paying "Degen" as a user, and in return, you earn "Alfa" monthly.
- You can claim the Alfars you earned whenever you want to your account.
- By staking "Alfa", you earn "degen" monthly.

Calculations are done instantly. For example, the amounts you earn or pay monthly are deducted from your account every second. If you subscribe to 500 Degen, 500 degen is deducted from your account every second and reaches 0 at the end of the month. So, if you unsubscribe, you only pay for the time you subscribed, or even if you have only 100 degen in your account, you can subscribe to a channel or channels that cost 500 degen.

Additionally, we can collect subscribers by opening our own channel, and we receive monthly payments per subscriber to our own channel.
